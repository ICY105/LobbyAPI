Lobby API is a tool for map/minigame creators to quickly add a robust lobby & team creation system. Currently features:

* Extensive config file to fine-tune or disable pretty much everything
* 2 team modes: fixed (set number of teams, up to 16) and ~~dynamic (players create their own teams, up to 100)~~ Currently WIP
* Both automatic and manual assigment of teams
* Intermission timer that will auto-start the next game if there are enough players
* Auto-ends game if everyone is dead
* Specator mode
* Handles players who leave mid match
* Dynamic player ID system
